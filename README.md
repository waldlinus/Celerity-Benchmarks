# Celerity-Benchmarks

This repository is part of our bachelorâ€™s thesis which we conducted at the University of Innsbruck. Here we provide our full code examples of all benchmark applications which we wrote for the thesis. Furthermore, in each application we provide the results in a .csv file.

## Benchmarks

- Memory Copy
- Heat Stencil
- Crystal Simulation
- Fluid Simulation

## Celerity

The Celerity framework is a joint research project by the University of Innsbruck and the Technical University of Berlin. Celerity allows to write parallel applications which can be deployed on large scale accelerated HPC systems. Further information can be found on the [Celerity website](https://celerity.github.io/).
